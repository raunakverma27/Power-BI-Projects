Its primary goal is to support upper management in making informed, strategic decisions based on key metrics and trends. The report is structured across five key pages, each serving a specific analytical purpose. --- ### Page 1 - Executive Dash: ![Executive Dash](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/604320c9-8477-4491-81b6-2b97db6b3657) This page is built for executives who need quick, high-level insights without digging through details. It highlights core KPIs such as revenue, profit, order count, and return rate using clean visuals like summary cards and trend charts. A four-year revenue trend is presented with a slicer to filter by specific years or months. The dashboard compares current and previous month performance on revenue, orders, and returns, offering context for evaluating progress toward targets. It also breaks down orders by product category, highlights the top 10 products by revenue and return rate, and identifies the most ordered and most returned sub-category. A page-level filter in the top-left corner enables year-specific views, all within a minimal, intuitive layout designed for fast, informed decision-making. --- ### Page 2 - Map: ![Sales by Location](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15cac93e-a762-4eea-ae3d-ac26ec64e186) The “Sales by Location” page presents a regional breakdown of order volume through an interactive map, allowing users to toggle between regions using built-in buttons. It provides a clear visual representation of geographic sales distribution, helping leadership identify which areas are performing well and which need attention. This page is particularly useful for regional sales strategy, resource allocation, and identifying markets with potential for growth. --- ### Page 3 - Product Detail: ![Product Detail](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/943902ee-2e24-418a-8943-c8f5e719fb7e) This page focuses on product-level insights and performance tracking. Users can select a specific product and view its total revenue, profit, order volume, and returns. A key feature is the “Price Adjustment” slider, which lets users simulate pricing changes and see their impact on both total and adjusted profit. The page also shows monthly target achievements for each product across orders, revenue, and profit, giving product teams actionable data for evaluating success, refining pricing strategies, and optimizing inventory planning. --- ### Page 4 - Customer Detail: ![Customer Detail](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9fdbf57-3085-4d82-8186-fd15ab6433fc) The “Customer Demographics” page breaks down total orders by customer occupation and income level, offering insights into purchasing behavior. It shows metrics such as unique customer count and revenue per customer, with a two-year trend line chart tracking changes in customer base and per-customer revenue. It also highlights the top 100 customers by number of orders and revenue contribution. A slicer allows users to filter visuals by year, helping marketing and business development teams better understand and segment the customer base for targeted outreach. --- ### Page 5 - Key Influencers: ![Key Influencers](https://github.com/211098647/443228329-9d699d82-93f2-449a-b6b8-6574caa97788.png?raw=true) The final page leverages Power BI’s AI and regression tools to uncover drivers behind key performance metrics.
